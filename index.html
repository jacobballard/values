    <p>The values that have led me to discover computer science are curiosity and a desire to help. I find computer science to be an extremely interesting and engaging
    subject that can lead to a lot of satisfaction.  It has also enabled me to help out my aunt's small business by working on her website.  My cause is to learn
      computer science to be able to better this website.  I will do this by looking at revnue reports over this past year and finding
      important facts that help improve revenue..</p>
